The OhioT1DM is split into train and test sets. In order to split the validation 
set from the train set, copy split_data.py (in either the LSTM or N-BEATS directory) 
to the same directory as the training data. By default, this script expects that both 
the 2018 and 2020 versions of the dataset are being used. If this is not the case, you 
can supply the file names with the --files command line option. Additionally, you can 
modify the default values for the --files option in the script to contain the desired 
file names. Run this script and it will create two files for each subject: PID-ws-training-new.xml 
and PID-ws-validation.xml. Create a directory called 'validation' in the same parent 
directory of the 'training' and 'testing' directories and copy the validation data into 
this directory.
	
After this step is complete, move to the directory corresponding to the model that 
you would like to use and modify lines 1491-1493 of load.py and change the path to 
the data directories to your path. Then you can run load.py. This can take a few minutes. 
Once complete you will have some pickle files containing the examples for the different 
scenarios. If you wish to load the examples for the carbs without bolus scenario, you 
must do the same with the load_carbs_wo_bolus.py script. Note that the file that is 
created has the same name as the carb data file generated by load.py, so you if you want 
to get results for all scenarios, you should complete the other three before starting this one.
	
Copy all of the files from the 'hyper_parameters' directory to the current directory. 
To run an experiment from start to finish (pretraining, finetuning, and evaluation) run 
the run.py script with the following command line arguments: '--scenario X' where X is carbs, 
bolus, or combo (for bolus given carbs scenario), '--case Y' where Y is either unrestricted 
or inertial, and '--runs Z' where Z is the number of runs per subject. 10 runs are used in 
the paper. For example, to train and evaluate the models for the carb recommendation scenario 
for the inertial class of examples, run the following command: 'python run.py --scenario carbs --case inertial --runs 10'. 
This will take some time. A file called 'results.json' will be created containing 
the best and average RMSE and MAE scores. An important note: when running the carbs without
bolus scenario, you will need to modify the patient lists for the carbs scenario in the run.py
file.
