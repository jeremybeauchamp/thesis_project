# Returns the RMSE and MAE

# meal in the time range of the example was predicted for each example. Used for

# Parameters:
# 	labels = the actual labels of the examples
# 	features = the same input features that would be given to the model
# 	scaling = the parameters used to scale the data
#
# Returns the RMSE and MAE
